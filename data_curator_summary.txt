First step in obtaining the O'Meara et. al., sample was downloading GM1570702, which was a short read file,  onto the SCC using the following 
	wget https://sra-downloadb.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sos1/sra-pub-run-5/SRR1727914/SRR1727914.1  
Then I renamed the file to P0_1.sra using
	mv SRR1727914.1.sra P0_1.sra
Next, to obtain FASTQ files from the SRA I ran a qsub, called run_extract.qsub (for more detail please review script)
This qsub contained modules and code required to produce the FASTQ files, including; 
	module fastqc
	module sratoolkit
	fastq-dump -I --split-files P0_1.sra 	which split the sra file into two because this invovles paired end reads 

Once this script was completed we ran the qsub using 
	qsub run_extract.qsub
This produced the two FASTQ files, P0_1_1.fastq and P0_1_2.fastq, along with FASTQC reports
